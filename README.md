- 👋 Hi, I’m Gabriel Livorsi Polidori (@Polidori-dev)

- 🐙 Senior Development Analyst at @Octalink

- 💞️ Passionate about programming and new challenges, I started developing out of obligation and saw it as an opportunity to change my life and take my technical level to another level.

- 👀 I have vast and solid knowledge in front-end development, my strong point is to create integrated interfaces meeting UI/UX design needs, with Angular 12, ReactJS, React Native and Clean Architecture.
